As of 03/27/2023. the code that works well was uploaded on 12/08/2022. This code introduces stress diffusion but only functional if gravity is on -z dierction and regularization is used.

The newest pushed code on 03/27/2023 introduces coheison into the constitutive law but run with issues. Need further modifications.
